## Summary of Search for Unfinished Projects and Incomplete Ideas

This log was generated by an AI agent performing a comprehensive search across the `memU` repository for indicators of ongoing work, drafts, or conceptual ideas.

**Search Criteria:**
*   Keywords in file content: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `WIP`, `incomplete`, `unfinished`, `draft`, `idea`, `brainstorm`.
*   File/directory naming patterns: `ideas/`, `drafts/`, `temp/`, `scratchpad.*`, `*_draft.md`, `*_idea.txt`, `*_wip.py`, `*_incomplete.json`, `notes/`, `brainstorm/`, `old/`, `backup/`.

**Findings:**

The primary unique finding was the detailed development log for the "Prompt Optimizer" project, which is included above. This log provides a clear overview of a significant refactoring effort, including completed and pending tasks, problem analysis, and solutions.

Other files encountered during the search were primarily:
*   Generic template files (e.g., empty `scratchpad.md` templates).
*   Completed documentation or example files from third-party repositories (e.g., `deskree-inc-blok` CLI documentation).
*   Auto-generated log notes about completed system deployments.

These were excluded from the log as they do not represent unique "unfinished projects" or "incomplete ideas" in the context of active development.

**Conclusion:**

The most significant "unfinished project" identified is the continued development of the "Prompt Optimizer" as detailed in the log above. This log serves as a valuable resource for understanding its current state and remaining tasks.
